                I understand that you have previously contacted our colleagues

                per ACCA policies, we cannot accept this reason for withdrawal

                request a withdrawal due to medical reasons, we require an
                official medical note or report from your Doctor/GP confirming
                that you are unable to attend the exam. It should mention your
                illness and the dates of the exam. Also if this document is not
                in English, we would also require an English translation stamped
                by an official translator. Additionally, we need a letter from
                the translator confirming the accuracy of the translation.

                I apologise that we have been unable to withdraw your exam based
                on the documents provided. To withdraw, we require an official
                letter from your school confirming the date of the exam,
                including your name, the name of your school, the date of the

                understand that you would like to withdraw from your exam. I
                request you provide us with necessary documentation such as a
                death certificate, obituary or funeral service program. Please

                You requested a withdrawal due to an exam clash and now say it
                is a medical reason; you will need to provide a new set of
                documents for us to review your case; these must be medical
                documents. We will not be processing your withdrawal at this

              <strong>Rejecting Withdrawal</strong>

                I'm sorry, but our decision is final; we will not process your
                exam withdrawal, and we ask that you sit your exam and submit a
                mitigating circumstance afterward. This will be taken into

                I am pleased to take you through the re-registration process. To
                book or sit an exam, you must re-register, which involves paying

                were removed from the register. If you have no outstanding fees,
                only the re-registration fee is required.

                account has been suspended due to non-payment of ACCA fees. You
                will need to pay the re-registration fee and any outstanding
                balance of your account to re-register with us. The outstanding
                balance at the time of removal was XX GBP, and the total amount
                required to re-register is XX GBP.

              <p><strong>Entry Requirements for ACCA Qualification</strong></p>
              <p>
                The minimum entry requirements for the ACCA Qualification are
                two A-Levels and three GCSEs (or their equivalent) in five
                separate subjects, including English and maths. Check if your
                qualifications meet the minimum entry requirements by visiting
                the minimum entrance requirements database.

              <p><strong>Entry Requirements for Foundation-level</strong></p>
              <p>
                There are no minimum entry requirements to start at any level.
                Still, it&#39;s recommended to start with the ACCA Diploma in
                Financial and Management Accounting (RQF Level 2) if you have no
                formal qualifications. This will help you perform better in
                higher-level exams.
